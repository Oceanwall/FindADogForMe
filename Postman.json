She knows many commands: sit, stay, kennel, fetch and is crate, leash and potty trained. She is a dream indoors! Never meets a stranger but can be a bit uneasy outdoors or with loud noises. She prefers men over women but loves both equally! When Freya isnâ\\u0080\\u0099t playing with her favorite toy (her soccer ball) sheâ\\u0080\\u0099s taking a nap in her crate or next to you on the sofa. She would be okay being left home alone uncrated and knows how to keep herself occupied with her toys! I believe she would thrive in a home with a fur brother or sister! She just needs someone to give her a chance to shine and show her the world! She listens very well and is always eager to please!

If you are looking to add a large mostly indoor dog to your home, who is pretty chill, and housebroken, then maybe Tinker is the dog for you! She has never been around children, so we are unsure if she will be good with little ones.. A meet & greet with any other dogs in the home is necessary. Tinker & her bestie, Daisy would love to be adopted together but would advise this if there are no other dogs in the home or cats.\\n\\nTinker is current on basic vaccinations including Bordetella and Rabies, been dewormed and is microchipped. She has tested Negative for Heartworms and has been on prevention. She is already spayed, so she's all ready to go to a new home. \\n\\nFor more information, please contact the City of Corsicana Animal Shelter at (903) 654-4928.

She loves to go hiking as you can tell from the photos of her.  You might notice that the trees are bare too.  Being a highly active dog in addition to being black, she gets overheated easily.  She walks well on her lease so she is nice to take hiking.  She is very cute when she can't decide where the hiking path is.  She will come back and to you and wait for you to lead the way.  The only problem is the other hikers.  Being a big, black dog, most people are afraid of her.  That makes her a good watch dog but that is all that makes her a good watch dog except she might lick them to death.  \\n\\nShe is VERY friendly.  Her friends currently include a large very senior male and two small dogs: a male and female.  She would love to have a dog she could run and play with as her current situation does not have that.  She is the submissive dog in the group.  All she wants is to be loved and have some activities.  I said no small children only because in her excitement she might knock them down and, of course, would promptly lick their faces.  \\n\\nAll of our animals are fully vet'ed, which includes at a minimum: being heartworm negative, being intestinal parasite free, having age appropriate shots, being spayed/neutered when they are old enough and, lastly, treatment for any conditions that the pet came in with including but not limited to treatment for heartworms, parvo, mange etc.  We never euthanize for any reason except a hopeless cause where the pet is suffering.\\n\\nYou can reach her foster at koolkatskanines@yahoo.com.\",\n            \"id\": \"31137925\",\n            \"image_1\": \"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31137925/1/?bust=1492743518&width=500&-x.jpg\",\n            \"image_2\": \"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31137925/2/?bust=1492743518&width=500&-x.jpg\",\n            \"image_3\": \"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31137925/3/?bust=1492743518&width=500&-x.jpg\",\n            \"image_4\": null,\n            \"name\": \"China\",\n            \"sex\": \"F\",\n            \"shelter_id\": \"TX944\",\n            \"shelter_name\": \"Kool Kats and Kanines\",\n            \"size\": \"L\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"age\": \"Adult\",\n            \"breed\": \"border collie\",\n            \"description\": \"Buddy is a 2 1/2 year old collie mix.

LSRR’s mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome horses and other farm animals.\\n\\nThe goats used for our yoga sessions are all bottle raised and people friendly.  These are not random rented  goats used to make a buck.  They are our pets and our friends.  We interact with them on a daily basis and make sure they have everything a goat could want and then some.  Feel free to come out to Lone Star and meet our friends.

While we do charge for the Yoga sessions, playtime with the goats is free for all to enjoy, so bring your family and friends to enjoy the goats. This will be our first session of the season and it will be the first time our newest baby goats will make an appearance.\\n \\nGoat Yoga is about disconnecting with day-to-day stress, sickness or depression and focusing on positive and happy vibes.  It is a time to enjoy these wonderful baby goats while supporting the efforts of Lone Star Ranch and Rescue, a horse rescue just outside of McKinney.\\n \\nThe Goat Yoga are hosted by Lone Star Ranch and Rescue (LSRR), a horse rescue based just minutes away from McKinney in beautiful Blue Ridge, Texas.  LSRR’s mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome horses and other farm animals.\\n\\nThe goats used for our yoga sessions are all bottle raised and people friendly.  These are not random rented  goats used to make a buck.  They are our pets and our friends.  We interact with them on a daily basis and make sure they have everything a goat could want and then some.  Feel free to come out to Lone Star and meet our friends.

He is a super sweet boy who came to us from the Austin Animal Center.  Shaunessy had some really bad teeth issues, but after those were fixed, he has gained some weight and is a happy healthy little boy!  Shaunessy has a cute low little grumble that he uses to talk about the TV or the butterfly or a squirrel in the yard or a toy that he likes today.  He has a cute personality and really likes to interact with his people.  Shaunessy gets along with other dogs well, but would do best in an only dog or one other dog home situation.  He currently sleeps in a crate, but would be happiest beside his owner either in the bed or next to the bed overnight.  When you come home from work, he will be waiting for you with a cute little spin and yap Woh-Woooorrrrr!  Shaunessy is a sweet little boy and would be a great addition to your home!

He's 12 years old. \\nThis dog is not with Small Chance Rescue, but a member of the public is trying to rehome him. Please contact Jenn at 903-357-0754 if you are interested in adopting him. Info from his owner below:\\n\\nMylo is great with dogs of all sizes, cats, rabbits... Iâ\\u0080\\u0099ve yet to find an animal he isnâ\\u0080\\u0099t good with, he even plays well with a friend's crazy Min-Pin. He is not at all good with kids. Heâ\\u0080\\u0099s never been great with them and the older heâ\\u0080\\u0099s gotten the worse heâ\\u0080\\u0099s gotten. He does tend to snap when someone pets him and he he doesnâ\\u0080\\u0099t want to or heâ\\u0080\\u0099s done being touched, which is new since the baby was born. He hates being outside for too long, something I think is due to him basically being a grouchy old man. He has faked injury for attention right after the baby was born.... So obviously personality for days. He loves his kennel, we call it his house and at bedtime we tell him to get in his house and he settles for the night. He is extremely attached to me to the point of aggression. He wonâ\\u0080\\u0099t let anyone touch him if heâ\\u0080\\u0099s sitting by me and will growl and bite if they try. Every time Levi (baby) cries, Mylo yelps like heâ\\u0080\\u0099s been hurt. Weâ\\u0080\\u0099ve done everything anyone has suggested and then some to fix this, as he has always been that way, but nothing has helped and itâ\\u0080\\u0099s gotten worse with the baby to the point of the attempted attack. Heâ\\u0080\\u0099s had a very good obviously spoiled life but itâ\\u0080\\u0099s now to where we have to keep him and the baby safe, and finding a better home for Mylo seems to be the best option. Heâ\\u0080\\u0099s in amazing health, I can get his records from the vet, if needed. He loves riding in the car and just being with me. He loves being lap dog and gives kisses. Heâ\\u0080\\u0099s house broken, kennel trained, leash trained can sit stay and lay down.\",\n            \"id\": \"44110673\",\n            \"image_1\": \"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/44110673/1/?bust=1551234812&width=500&-x.jpg\",\n            \"image_2\": \"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/44110673/2/?bust=1551234812&width=500&-x.jpg\",\n            \"image_3\": null,\n            \"image_4\": null,\n            \"name\": \"Mylo (Courtesy Listing)\",\n            \"sex\": \"M\",\n            \"shelter_id\": \"TX1148\",\n            \"shelter_name\": \"Small Chance Rescue\",\n            \"size\": \"S\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"page\": 1,\n    \"total_pages\": 1\n}"

She is a 2 1/2 year old, female, Border Collie/Boxer mix. She loves to play with toys and other dogs! Sheâ\\u0080\\u0099s a super sweet cuddler who is also great with kids. She knows many commands: sit, stay, kennel, fetch and is crate, leash and potty trained. She is a dream indoors! Never meets a stranger but can be a bit uneasy outdoors or with loud noises. She prefers men over women but loves both equally! When Freya isnâ\\u0080\\u0099t playing with her favorite toy (her soccer ball) sheâ\\u0080\\u0099s taking a nap in her crate or next to you on the sofa. She would be okay being left home alone uncrated and knows how to keep herself occupied with her toys! I believe she would thrive in a home with a fur brother or sister! She just needs someone to give her a chance to shine and show her the world! She listens very well and is always eager to please! To foster or adopt Freya, please apply at\\nwww.hhfrescue.org\\n\\nThe adoption fee includes vaccinations, bordetella, deworming, rabies, spay/neuter and microchip. There is an additional $10.99 fee for Home Again for a lifetime registration of the microchip. If adopting a puppy, the rabies and spay/neuter will be done at the same time by our vet once they are 4 months old and billed to us. It is against the law in the State of Texas for a rescue not to be sterilized so we have to make sure it gets completed and that we have record of it.\\n\",\n            \"id\": \"41868723\",\n            \"image_1\": \"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41868723/1/?bust=1554390629&width=500&-x.jpg\",\n            \"image_2\": \"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41868723/2/?bust=1554390633&width=500&-x.jpg\",\n            \"image_3\": \"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/41868723/3/?bust=1554390635&width=500&-x.jpg\",\n            \"image_4\": null,\n            \"name\": \"Freya\",\n            \"sex\": \"F\",\n            \"shelter_id\": \"TX2153\",\n            \"shelter_name\": \"Honoring Hope and Faith Rescue, Inc.\",\n            \"size\": \"L\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"page\": 1,\n    \"status\": 200,\n    \"total_pages\": 7\n}"
